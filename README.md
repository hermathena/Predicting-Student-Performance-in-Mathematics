# Predicting-Student-Performance-in-Mathematics
This project analyses data from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository to predict student performance in a final mathematics exam, across two schools, based on demographic, social, and other features.
# Insights
A history of failiures is strongly negatively correlates with performance. The schools could work to ensure that students do not develop a history of failiure.
Absences correlates with lower scores. The schools could work to improve attendence of students at risk of poor performance.
One of the schools correlates with lower scores. Both schools could collaborate to improve the performance at this school.
The desire of students to pursue higher education positively correlated with performance. The schools could work to encourage this ambition.
Recieving extra support at school is negatively correlated with performance. Schools could evaluate the support programs to uncover whether there are issues with the programs, or if it is a selection bias. It at least seems possible that the support programs are not achieving their goals.
